# SAGE

SAGE is the Search Aggregation Engine developed and maintained by [Texas A&M University Libraries](http://library.tamu.edu).

SAGEâ€™s feature set includes both the ability aggregate disparate searchable sources into a common Solr index, as well as the ability expose Solr indexes through a dynamic user interface.

### User Documentation

SAGE boasts an intuitive user interface, but some much needed user documentation is currently a work in progress.

### SAGE Default Solr

```bash
   cd SAGE/solr
   docker build --tag=sage/solr .
   docker run -p 8983:8983 sage/solr
```
